Its a fun word game!
All the rules have been thoroughly explained when the python files are run. It uses file handling texhnique to covertly input the word using one program and play with the word using another. Technically, User 1 is to enter the word to be guessed by OTHER USERS. I hope you enjoy this simple word game presented via python!
